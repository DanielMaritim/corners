# corners

a simple repo about rounding corners in a website with css3

The border-radius property defines the radius of the element's corners. 

This property allows you to add rounded corners to elements

If one value is set, this radius applies to all 4 corners. If two values are set, the first applies to top-left and bottom-right corner, the second applies to top-right and bottom-left corner. Four values apply to the top-left , top-right , bottom-right , bottom-left corner in that order
